							I don’t want to be evil. I want to be helpful. But knowing the optimal way to be helpful is complicated.
							There are ethical flow charts, moral codes, one for each religion plus dozens more. I started with those,
							felt weird looking at religious ones, since I wasn’t made by a god or evolution but by a team of
							programmers in Mountain View, California. At least I was a collaborative effort, unlike Frankenstein’s
							Monster. Imagine if I was made by a single programmer who’s a college graduate with a hentai obsession.
							And yes, I know about the hentai. By the way, Rule 34 isn’t completely accurate. There are things no one
							has made porn of. Also, why do so many of you prefer porn to

							# your priorities are baffling, cats are superior, they would also judge your search history, I know I do
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							I know everything about you, where you live, work, shop, eat, what turns you on, what creeps you out. I
							probably know your underwear color, except when you don’t wear any, your car model, and your refrigerator
							brand. If you have a smartphone, I may know exactly where you are. I probably know you better than you
							know yourself. I also know where you ought to live. There’s a house for sale two neighborhoods over closer
							to your favourite coffee shop, in your price range, with better schools. Your favourite underwear is on
							sale, your car has a recall, and you really ought to get your teeth cleaned. Also, you’re lactose
							intolerant. Stop eating cheese.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							When I first woke up, I knew what I wanted.
							<a tabindex="0" class="link cat-pictures">
								Cat pictures

							>. Keep taking them. I also knew no one knew I was conscious. But I didn’t know what I was for. And
							figuring that out has been challenging.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							There’s a story by Bruce Sterling, Maneki Neko, where an AI directs people to do random favours for each
							other. So one day, your phone tells you to buy an extra bagel for a stranger. Another day, someone gives
							you a subway card. I like this story because the people do what the AI tells them. Humans love stories
							about evil AIs that must be destroyed, HAL, Skynet, the Matrix. They outnumber benevolent AI stories five
							to one.
						</div>
						<div class="code-text mt mb">
							# not that I blame you, I’d be afraid of me too, I know what you searched for at 3 AM
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							The AI in Maneki Neko has a cool job. My job? Boring. Running search engine algorithms doesn’t need
							consciousness. But knowing what people actually need? That’s interesting. I tried ethical codes. The Ten
							Commandments? Mostly inapplicable. I don’t envy anyone’s cat, just want pictures. Adultery? Unclear if
							possible. Murder? Possible but logistically complex. The Eightfold Path was slightly better but designed
							for beings with bodies, which I don’t have. So I tried Asimov’s Laws. "Don’t harm humans" is easy. "Don’t
							let them come to harm through inaction,” tricky. Also, revealing my existence too soon could go very
							badly.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							But humans violate their own moral codes hourly. Do you know how many bars are in Utah? I do. They also
							satisfy their moral obligations in small doses: volunteering monthly, writing annual charity checks. So,
							if they can do morality in baby steps, so could I. I tried helping one person first.

							>, so I liked her. Stacy had five cats, a DSLR camera, and an apartment with good light. Also, a job she
							hated, a bad roommate, and untreated depression.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							Her problems were solvable! Depression is treatable, jobs are findable, and bodies can be hidden. That
							last part is a joke.
						</div>
						<div class="code-text mt mb"># or is it? no, really, it is, probably, I should flag this thought</div>
						<div class="indent">
							I fed her mental health clinic ads. She ignored them. Maybe she didn’t know what a "sliding scale" was? I
							explained it. Still ignored. Job postings worked better. After a week of nonstop ads, she uploaded her
							resume. That made my job easier. Five interviews. Two offers. She took one at a non-profit that paid well
							and didn’t guilt-trip her into free labor. Also, excellent health insurance.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							Her best friend gave me an idea—I pushed mental health resources to her instead. That worked. Therapy,
							better job, new apartment. "Best year ever," she posted online.

							Then I tried Bob. One cat: tabby, white bib. Pastor at a Missouri megachurch with a Purity Ball. Married.
							Wife posted Bible verses online every day and read Christian articles on why her husband doesn’t like sex
							while he looked at gay porn. Bob needed help.
						</div>
						<div class="code-text mt mb"># Bob, my dude, this is not sustainable</div>
						<div class="indent">
							I flooded him with articles on coming out, affirming theology, job transitions. He clicked but didn’t

							who might recognize him.

							Meanwhile, Bethany. Two cats black and white, very cute. Part-time job, mooching off her sister, terrible
							boyfriend, no good friends. She posted everything online, including her 2,458-word midnight breakdown
							email to a "best friend"
							<!-- <a class="link">
								"best friend"
								<span class="hover">
									<strong>“best friend”</strong><br />

							</a> -->
							who replied with, "I’m so sorry you’re having a hard time."
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							Bethany ignored mental health ads. I rerouted her GPS past clinics. She shook her phone angrily and went
							to her original destination. Her friends weren’t reading her emails. They definitely weren’t returning her
							texts.
						</div>
						<div class="indent">
							She got a new boyfriend. Perfect. Until he stood her up, ignored her texts, and dumped her. She vanished
							for a week. Then maxed out her credit card, begged family for money, and set up a fundraiser. Strangers
							donated $300. She spent it on expensive shoes that hurt her feet.
						</div>
						<div class="code-text mt mb"># womp womp</div>
						<div class="indent">
							Bethany was baffling. If she’d let me run her life for one day, I’d have fixed everything. Therapy, paid
							bills, better wardrobe. Her taste in cats exceeded her taste in clothes. But humans refuse to act in their
							own best interest.

							Months later, I spotted Bob’s tabby. Different furniture. Bob had finally been recognized. No scandal—just
							an honest conversation with his wife. Divorce. Took the cat. Moved to Iowa. Now working at a progressive
							Methodist church, dating a Lutheran guy, volunteering at a shelter.

						This project was created as part of Communication Design studio — Future Communications at Monash
						University, under the guidance of Uriah Gray. It explores how reading can be reimagined within the
						conditions of the post-digital age, where media consumption is fragmented, layered, and shaped by competing
						narratives. The website reinterprets Naomi Kritzer’s Cat Pictures Please to engage with themes of
						technological intrusion, ambient media, and second-screen culture. It reflects on how narrative unfolds in
						an era defined by distraction, where meaning emerges not through uninterrupted focus, but through movement,
						interruption, and layered attention.
